# The Real Risk of AI: Laziness

Everyone talks about AI being too powerful, too smart, maybe even too dangerous. But the biggest risk might be something far more mundane: **human laziness.**

AI gets better the more it learns from us — our writing, our art, our code, our ideas. The early internet was a goldmine for this: billions of people posting their thoughts, their work, their creativity in public. That’s what fueled the rise of large language models.

But what happens when people stop?

If AI makes it easier to generate “good enough” output, fewer people will struggle through the hard part of creating something original. Instead of publishing new ideas, we’ll recycle old ones through prompts. Instead of adding to the cultural soil, we’ll strip it bare.

The **printing press** was different. It democratized knowledge, and in doing so it created more authors, more thinkers, more inventors. It was an equalizer that expanded originality.

AI risks flipping that script. If everyone leans back and lets the model do the work, then we’re left with models learning from their own recycled exhaust. The result isn’t intelligence — it’s homogeneity.

Of course, AI will also **encourage new forms of creativity** — interactive stories, generative art, games, and ideas we haven’t even imagined yet. But the danger is the same one we saw with television: if you only *ingest* it, and never get up to move, to write, to build, to create, it has the power to quietly drain hours, days, even years of your life with nothing in return.

And here’s the paradox: this post, warning about AI laziness… was written by AI.

So — does that make me lazy too?
